It's possible to do this (surprisingly), so here are the steps to make this all work again:

1. Go to "C:\Program Files\PuTTY" and open the .exe
2. Set the port to "COM3", the speed to 115200, the Connection Type to Serial and the flow control to None.
3. Run it. If the console appears blank, just hit enter to make sure that there is a ">>>".

4. Go to the CMD and cd into the directory of your files (TBot2)
5. Run "ampy --port COM3 put test.py" with whatever file you want to port to the board.
(If you can't do this, just close the console)
6. Finally, head to the console and type either:
"execfile("test.py")"
or "import test", and everything should be running :)))


And here's the next steps to take in order to make this work fully:

1. Firstly, we can't use dates. Figure out how to make a bot without dates. 
   ChatGPT said utime, but I doubt it.
2. IMPORTANT; A Python file named "main.py" inside the microcontroller 
   will (supposedly) always run on startup.
3. Make sure that the board can access the internet(?). I'm scared of this one.

ANY DOUBTS? ASK CHATGPT
