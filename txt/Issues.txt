1. We are calling our function every 60 seconds, but the data is the exact same for the entire day.
Maybe we could get data for every hour that passes?
Maybe the data isn't dependant on the day because there's multiple numbers each day?
Maybe we're doomed

2. I have no clue if any of the code I wrote actually works and even though I will
get to test it, there will probably be errors everywhere and I won't be able to find them.

3. I am not sure if I should stick to the initial SMA, due to the lack of evidence I have that they
will work. And maybe I am doing too many strategys at once? I don't think so, what could really happen
due to having too many strategys if they all work?


Update in the Arduino board:

- In Arduino, there are 2 folders. (Supposedly) "test1.py" connects the board to the internet succesfully,
but I cannot check because the "setup()" function won't print. I tried sniffing the devices
in the network to see if the board is connected, but I can't seem to do that.

Next I need to see if it is actually connected to the internet, or try to make the "setup()" 
function work. When that's done we will go ahead and check if we can mix Arduino for the wifi and 
MicroPython for the script or even if we can make both run automatically.
